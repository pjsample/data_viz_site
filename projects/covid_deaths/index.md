    <h3>Relating COVID-19 to 9/11</h3>
    <p>
         The September 11th, 2001 terrorist attack was a profoundly visceral experience for people all over the world
         and especially so for US citizens. <span class="lives_lost">2,977</span> lives were needlessly lost and the
         response from the US government was severe.
         This includes the war on terror which, as of December 2020, has cost 6.5 trillion dollars, resulted in the longest, 
         and still continuing, war in US history, and ultimately the loss of nearly <span class="lives_lost">7,000</span> 
         American lives. Domestic issues also
         saw a dramatic shift with the implementation of stricter immigration policies, the overhaul of airport security,
         the justification for mass survelience programs, and trauma to the American psyche which has left many more distrustful
         of people with different backgrounds and beliefs from their own.
     </p>
     <p>
         The response to the novel coronavirus of 2019, on the other hand, has been woefully inadequate despite the staggering
         death toll and impact on our economy. This applies to both the malaise of the US government and the alarming unwillingness
         of large swaths of the American public to endure inconveniences such as wearing masks and traveling less often, not to
         mention the outright denialism that too many share.
     </p>
     <p>
         The figures below intend to show the magnitude of the loss of American lives attributed to 
         <span class="covid">COVID-19</span> in relation to major US
         wars. No data-based visualization can convey humanity and its destruction but maybe by thinking of these numbers in
         in units of the lives lost on 9/11, an event that was immediate and tangible if only for a moment, we can get a 
         little closer.
