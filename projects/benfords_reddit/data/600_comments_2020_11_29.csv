1,kpdeadwolf,"happy holidays and thanks so much for offering, this sounds super cool!

i’d love it if you could draw my character [remy](https://imgur.com/a/kxcfyqj) in spot #16. he’s 16 years old and very arrogant but also very charismatic, so it would be great if you could draw him trying to bullshit the bartender into serving him a drink, even though he’s clearly underage. he’s also technically a half-elf, but leans more on the human side so doesn’t need any more elvish features. the current art i have is also of him as a classic dnd character, so if you feel like you need to change his outfit to fit more in with the scene that’s totally cool!

75,macintacos,"some minor points of clarification (since i’ve been going through this dance myself of trying to get a config going that makes vscode feel more like spacemacs):

- a bunch of the time, the keybindings won’t work simply because vscodevim relies on your cursor being in the _editor_, where the extension is active. if you’re in search/terminal/explorer etc., most motions/chords that rely on the vscodevim extension won’t work. i found this to be a pretty big let-down, and basically moved to trying to emulate spacemacs chords at the default keybindings level rather than in the vim extension settings. and that’s a bummer, because...
- vscode doesn’t support three chord shortcuts natively, unfortunately ([#6966](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/6966)), so getting native shortcuts that are similar to spacemacs won’t work outside of the editor until that is implemented. additionally...
- as a newbie, spacemacs’ mnemonic shortcuts are really great... once you know them. unfortunately, because it doesn’t have a helm-like pop up to show you what part of the chord you’re in, even if vscode supported three chord shortcuts it’d be really abrasive to figure out all the shortcuts ([#3969](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/3969)). for example, i haven’t tried vspacecode, but it’s possible that the shortcut for assigning an editor below was `spc w -`, but without the pop up, figuring that out is annoying. there’s an extension called “[leadermode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemname=michaelgriscom.leadermode)”, but i find it to not be quite what i’m looking for.
- the “find” window that you saw is on the left by default, but can be placed in the bottom “panel” thing (which is where i put it because, i agree, the text being truncated kinda isn’t great).

i’d also like to point out that there’s actually a pretty nice neovim extension ([link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemname=asvetliakov.vscode-neovim)) that i’ve been using in lieu of vscodevim, perhaps you could check that out. it seems to work much more the way that i “expect” vim to work, because it’s not really _emulating_ neovim... it’s using _embedded_ neovim. wouldn’t really get past any of the caveats i noted above though. 

aside from that, nice vid, i’ll be checking out vspacecode later!

79,Rainer74,"let's stick to english, if you don't mind:)

actually your question is quite relevant. it works like this: a few months after the end of each tax year, every german bank/broker will provide you with a jahressteuerbescheinigung (free of charge). this document tells you very detailed, which amount you have to fill into which line of the anlage kap. all you have to do is, to collect those documents from each of your bank accounts, add the values and enter the sum into anlage kap.

you probably know it, but since i am already writing:

in germany there is no tax on property. only capital gains are taxed i.e. interests on savings (zinsen), dividends (ausschüttung), gains from buying &amp; selling stocks/bonds (kursgewinne) etc. the capital gains tax is called abgeltungssteuer (25%) and you pay an extra \~5% soli on that tax amount (effectively 26.375%). this tax is automatically subtracted by your bank/broker and transferred to the finanzamt, at the moment you realize the capital gain. there is a 801€ tax free amount per single person per year. you can fill a form (easy to do online) at your bank and request to not tax your cap. gains until this amount (""freistellungsauftrag"").

at the end of the year the sum of all capital gains of all your banks/brokers is compared to that 801€ in anlage kap. if your gains are  below, you'll get a complete refund of the abgeltungsteuer that was subtrated by the banks. any amount above is liable to cap. gains tax of ~~23.4%~~ 26.4% and you'll get a partial refund if you did not use up your 801€ tax free amount already. otherwise, your tax duty is already done (because of the automatic process at the bank).

note this only works for german banks/brokers! there are some exceptions link degiro, which is actually dutch.",Finanzen,37,31,21,6,9,8,8,11,5

i rely mostly on mechanical drives for backup, as well as some optical drives, as both are inexpensive.  i also run the backups overnight when the few extra minutes for the backup don't really matter.  it's also all done on a nas, and all the home computers are backed up.  i guess you could do the backup on an ssd to speed it up, and then automatically move it to the nas to speed up the process, but i haven't seen a need for that.  

as far as your wd red, four years is still just a baby for those drives, or that is my experience.  i have some 10 year old 3tb reds still chugging along in a nas all still showing excellent health, and they have been on 24 hours a day 7 days a week.  i think those are the best drives, and prefer the 5400rpm drives over the 7200rpm red pros because they run so much cooler.

145,Bushwookie762,"overall, i like it. list has a cool fluffy feel, and i imagine would look really cool on the table. that said, i imagine it would have some real difficulties in game.

120 poxwalkers would be a really great visual on the table.  but, poxwalkers are slow tar pits (very good tar pits imho) but struggle to earn their points back. 4"" move with no means to advance and assault hurts their offensive potential massively as a melee only unit. 

mortarion can be targeted at any point hes not locked in melee,  making him easy to get blasted off the table, and thus not really earn his points back.

3 plagueburst crawlers are a decent base of fire, but even with ac, they're not hitting hard enough with the mortars to focus down bigger, more durable things, and unless they're all in range with the plaguespitters, they're not throwing a lot of dice in general.  hordes would be problematic.  these are your only real shooting units at 2000 points, and they're less than 1/4 of your army, points-wise.

coffers is a good card, don't get me wrong, but it's functionally a mana doubler along the lines of [[doubling cube]], and isn't even mana positive until you have 4 swamps. even hitting a land every turn including both coffers and urborg, that's a t4 sol land, barely better than temple of the false god.

sure, it feels good to have coffers tap for 17 mana or something, but that doesn't happen until much later in the game. that's not ""explosive"". tower can enable plays like t1 land, dork, t2 tower, 4 mana available. that's just like having a t1 sol ring or exploration, both of which launch a player far enough ahead to be threatening on their own. and that's not even getting into all the value you can build by having a free sac outlet, even if it's only once per turn cycle.",EDH,77,60,46,13,19,17,13,16,9

it should also be noted that the excuse of irony had a long historical tradition of being used to disclaim genuinely held beliefs, since classical times. for example, in praise of folly erasmus wrote a book which was narrated by the persona of ""folly"". this starts of very facetious, with her making lots of ludicrous claims, but ends with her making trenchant criticisms of the church which erasmus could claim weren't actually criticisms, because folly was the mouthpiece, as she was obviously mad, so any criticisms of the church that people saw were due to them misinterpreting his work, and not understanding it's irony.

210,amishcatholic,"james joyce's *portrait of the artist as a young man* is some of the most beautiful prose ever--particularly the end of chapter 4. here's an excerpt from that section:   


he was alone. he was unheeded, happy and near to the wild heart of life. he was alone and young and wilful and wildhearted, alone amid a waste of wild air and brackish waters and the seaharvest of shells and tangle and veiled grey sunlight and gayclad lightclad figures of children and girls and voices childish and girlish in the air.

a girl stood before him in midstream, alone and still, gazing out to sea. she seemed like one whom magic had changed into the likeness of a strange and beautiful seabird. her long slender bare legs were delicate as a crane’s and pure save where an emerald trail of seaweed had fashioned itself as a sign upon the flesh. her thighs, fuller and softhued as ivory, were bared almost to the hips, where the white fringes of her drawers were like feathering of soft white down. her slateblue skirts were kilted boldly about her waist and dovetailed behind her. her bosom was as a bird’s, soft and slight, slight and soft as the breast of some darkplumaged dove. but her long fair hair was girlish: and girlish, and touched with the wonder of mortal beauty, her face.

she was alone and still, gazing out to sea; and when she felt his presence and the worship of his eyes her eyes turned to him in quiet sufferance of his gaze, without shame or wantonness. long, long she suffered his gaze and then quietly withdrew her eyes from his and bent them towards the stream, gently stirring the water with her foot hither and thither. the first faint noise of gently moving water broke the silence, low and faint and whispering, faint as the bells of sleep; hither and thither, hither and thither; and a faint flame trembled on her cheek.

—heavenly god! cried stephen’s soul, in an outburst of profane joy.

he turned away from her suddenly and set off across the strand. his cheeks were aflame; his body was aglow; his limbs were trembling. on and on and on and on he strode, far out over the sands, singing wildly to the sea, crying to greet the advent of the life that had cried to him.

her image had passed into his soul for ever and no word had broken the holy silence of his ecstasy. her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. to live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life! a wild angel had appeared to him, the angel of mortal youth and beauty, an envoy from the fair courts of life, to throw open before him in an instant of ecstasy the gates of all the ways of error and glory. on and on and on and on!",books,112,94,62,25,27,22,18,22,14

221,[deleted],"by fighting my employers every step of the way.

they tried to say it was legal to work us 7 days a week. called the proper authorities and they were not only warned, but had to put up offical paper work in all the break rooms.

then they started to try and pull some bullshit saying their days of the week were different in comparison to the states laws. called the proper authorities again. once again they got slapped and made to put up more paperwork.

after that they started trying to wait until the last second to post over time, which is against what the employee handbook states. when they said they didn't care i called corporate and lodged a complaint. offending manager was suspended for two weeks for saying they didn't care what corporate policy was.

every time they fuck up, no matter how minor i rock the boat as hard as i can. i've had multiple people this year suspended without pay because of it.

i take a half day every monday and friday until i'm completely out of sick time, vacation time and personal time. 

i spend as much time as possible in the bathroom while doing the bare minimum of work. employers cannot legally regulate my bathroom time and cannot have a camera within 30ft of the doors to the bathroom, showers or locker rooms.

i steal anything i can that is useful to me.

i spread union propaganda and paper work. not because we will ever unionize, but because it drives them nuts.

also am selling weed. making enough money i'm about 6 months from quitting my job.

i take solace in the fact i make my employers jobs as hard as possible.

if my benifits and pay were reasonable, i wouldn't do any of this. but i work in a place that a single shift pays for our wages for a entire year.

i also make sure to play within the rules set forth by corporate and state laws. if they fire me, i'll collect unemployment and food assistance for 6 months while i apply for jobs i know i'll never have a chance to actually get while still fulfilling the requirement to apply for 3 jobs a week.",AskMen,116,98,68,27,27,25,19,22,14

231,The_Promised_Land,"i meant in the sense of showing promise as a young and upcoming coach. can't really think of someone more exciting in this department. 

&gt; this won't be popular, but jurgen klopp in 2016 is the closest comparison you can make to a young fergie from 1986.

hmm that's an interesting take and i see what you mean. the thing is that i believe he was a bit of a washed up coach after his dortmund team was found out (cede possession to them, they relied too much on transitions anyways) and burnt out the team. there were problems which weren't of his making, but then there were other things - shmidt's leverkusen outdid him on the opening day of the season, spielverlagerung lambasted him for being averse to triangulations etc more tactical issues. 

i also think it took klopp to finally realise his gegenpress needed to be toned down at liverpool, so he parted ways with his expert assistant buvac for ljinders and moved to establish more possession based and a measured style of playing. twice in lvg's recent interviews, he has referred to this - that being too reliant on pressing to provoke space wasn't the right thing and that 'he's seen the light now'. 

though i must agree that in terms of winning trophies, his delegation to assistant coaches, managing of players etc you have more of a point that i do. fergie was never found out at all though. then again, you can't ask that from anyone.",reddevils,118,106,68,28,27,25,19,24,14

following day, he meets my friend and i and tells us ""i can't fly with this, so let's smoke it to get rid of it"".  

3 guys.  less than a gram, two small nugs of purple, soon to be legal weed.  all experienced pot users.

you can't completely salvage this friendship without it being one-sided, so maybe just try and step back from her gradually and let things fizzle out. if she asks why, be honest and tell her it's because she's inattentive and doesn't actually care about what you say, feel or think but just wants to talk about herself. it kind of sounds like she's struggling with a basic part of human relationships most people learn before age 7.",relationship_advice,140,127,82,31,42,31,27,36,17

&gt;**regarding how to request a refund**: you may want to get support by selecting the product you are experiencing issues with from [here](https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/helpwithgame) or by asking in our community support thread which is usually pinned at the top of the subreddit.

275,miraculous-,"let's preface this by saying that until i was 16 or so, i was an overweight spaz who resembled a young jack black. over the course of a year i lost fifty pounds and got my shit together, but my reputation at school had already been solidified.

anyway, my friends dragged me out to hang out with some girls they met when i was like 17.

i caught the eye of one of them, and my buddy heard she wanted to add me on msn. i thought he was bullshitting me because she was way out of my league but it was true. the next day i talked to her online and asked her if she wanted to go for a walk because she lived pretty close and it was a nice evening.

we ended up laying in the middle of a soccer field just talking for hours and staring up at the stars. she then asked me to go with her to a house party her friend was throwing in a couple days.

at the party after getting settled, out of nowhere she just climbed on me and started kissing me. time stopped. i remember the song that was playing at the time, what she was wearing, what i was wearing, everything about that night.

we made it official that night and she became my first serious girlfriend. we dated for almost three years until some stuff happened that i don't want to get into.


it did wonders for my confidence. i wasn't overly popular at my school, but she went to another school so she didn't care. i remember the looks on the faces of everyone at prom when i walked in with her. it was one of the highlights of my life. i felt completely vindicated.",AskReddit,144,130,83,31,45,32,29,36,17

310,JeremySzal,"&gt; hey jeremy!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; first off, great stuff. thank you so much for your post on all this. as a new writer, i'm trying to get an understanding about just how extensive the process is. thanks for shedding a bit more light on this topic.
&gt; 
&gt; 

thank you!
&gt; 
&gt; question, i was wondering what the process was like to get an editor and agent? was it really expensive? how long did it take? my end game goal is to also get a trilogy published by a big five publisher someday. currently sitting at (an unedited) 40k words on my first fantasy novel. any tips on where to begin after it's ready?
&gt; 
&gt; 

the author never pays a cent in traditional publishing. all money flows to the author, always. if an agent's charging you a fee, run like hell for the hills. with a battle-axe. 

it took me 4 years to get an agent, when i started looking in 2013 (i was 17 at the time). in that time, i started 5 books, finished 4, queried 3. i sent my novel to about 25 before my agent offered me representation. even that book didn't sell, and after we got rejected by most editors, we sent stormblood on submission in february 2018. gillian redfearn at gollancz said she was interested, but wanted some changes made before offering to buy. i made them, and in october 2018, the novel went to acquisitions and was taken on. 

when your book is finished, don't make my mistake and send it out to every agent on the internet. let it settle for a month or three. come back to it objectively. re-assess what your book is trying to do, where it's strengths are. i can't recommend getting beta-readers, who are other writers who aren't your friends, to critique it for you. if you get the right ones, their advice as potential readers is very helpful. the years of rejections helped me polish and enhance my craft until i was good enough for the right people to notice. always look for ways to improve.
&gt; 
&gt; also curios on thoughts of finishing the trilogy before seeking editors/publishing etc. by the sounds of it, it may be more difficult. i have plans for a second book already and some plot. really just want to get an idea of where to go for the second step once i feel that it's ready to send off where it needs to go first.
&gt; 
&gt; 

focus on writing and polishing book 1. don't even think about sequels yet. i put all my focus into making book 1 the best it could be, and able to be read as standalone, with series potential. i know peers who've had one book deals, and five book deals. don't make it harder on yourself by making your first book part 1 of 3. the sandersons of the world can get away with it. the rest of us aren't so lucky. 
&gt; 
&gt; thank you so much for your time, you've already been very, very helpful. congratulations on stormblood!

my pleasure! i wish you all the best.",Fantasy,163,143,94,37,53,34,34,38,20

316,jimnms,"i had an idea about this before it happened in a recent rlcs game.  i had a demoed opponent respawn in front of me while i was dribbling from the corner to an open net, which pinched the ball out where his team mate was able to take it and score, resulting in what should have been a goal for my team being a goal for the other team.  it always seemed that respawning in your own corner gives you a defensive advantage.  there have been many times where i was in mid position on offense, and demoed by an opponent coming back to their half, right when their team turns the possession around, but i respawn back near my net just in time to make a save.  had i not been demoed, they probably would have scored.

my idea is sort of like how in other sports, the teams have a sideline where players sub in from, or a penalty box.  each team in rocket league would get a respawn box on one side of the field.  a demoed player immediately respawns in the box, but can't drive onto the field until their 3 second time is up.  it would require editing the maps, but i think it would be neat.  they could put a door on the demo box that opens to let the player on the field.",RocketLeague,164,145,98,38,53,34,34,39,20

the optiplex 7020 or 9020 are this: https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/l-yaaoswxtvcqvxn/s-l1600.jpg

and the lenovo m83/m93 are this: https://sc01.alicdn.com/kf/htb10psgolfh8kjjy1xbq6zldxxab/high-quality-desktop-motherboard-m93-m93p-m8500.jpg

these motherboards are essentially decently featured micro-atx boards. i checked the info for your old board https://www.gigabyte.com/motherboard/ga-880gm-usb3-rev-1x#ov) and they should have all of it's features and a bit more. 

apart from better cpu, they also have an extra x16 length slot (running at x4), where you can add some extra peripheral (for example, you can get m.2 -&gt; pcie adapters so you could an m.2 drive from the slot). also, their main x16 slot is pcie 3.0, which means double the bandwidth compared to your current x16 slot (pcie 2.0).

of course, that might not matter unless you run some pcie card there that needs the bandwidth, but it's nice in principle to have the expandability :)

about 1.5x the performance sounds about right for the i5-4570 vs a non overclocked high end phenom of that generation. of course, the main thing there is that  this increase applies also to the single-core performance, which is the main thing that will be noticeable for casual use. note that on these corporate boards you do lose overclocking, but of course that also reduces the risk of wear and stress on the board, so should in principle allow for longer lifespan.

what country are you in btw.? i could check what seems the most reasonable options there. it's true that these kinds of  corporate machines are much more affordable in the us. i'm in europe and there is always a signficant extra cost added on in form of shipping and taxes!

what kind of performance boost would you be looking for in order to justify an upgrade? i can check what might be possible at a given low budget, but it quickly gets quite hard because higher end cpus of a given generation can be quite expensive even though they are old.

edit: there are also more esoteric options like getting a chinese x79 (lga 2011) board and putting an e5 xeon in them. you would get less increase in single core speed per $, but much higher multicore speed per $. you'd lose the integrated graphics, though, and there is also the added risk of buying the chinese boards (they are 3rd party clones made in china).",buildapc,169,148,101,39,53,35,35,40,21

server crashes, bugs and glitches. every day when the daily challenges change, i experience two hours of constantly being kicked from online. i’ve also noticed that camp being pitched works great for a week or so after a content update and then it goes back to taking anywhere from 15-45 minutes to set it up. animal spawn rates are being impacted by the number of players in a session at the moment.

and these are just the issues i have faced in the few months i have been playing.

one of my previous bosses often said tenant references were more important to him than credit checks (but, that is, like you said - *if* those references aren't falsified.  someone else mentioned using background checks since the guy had theft and fraud charges, but i don't know of any landlord who does that or if it's even legal to do so for rentals.",PersonalFinanceCanada,187,162,103,44,60,42,38,44,24

**song of iron** is a side scroller i have been working on solo for about 6 months.  the clip is a collection of moments that i have recorded recently while trying to iron out the combat. i am really pushing to get to a realistic feeling combat something fairly grounded with realistic timing and natural animations.i am majorly inspired by inside and journey and other games like them. it has been an amazing experience trying to get a really evocative mood like those games have. i have a long way to go, but i think it is headed in the right direction. interested to know what you all think.the look and feel of the game i credit majorly to the camera which is set very far back from the character. then using a really tight fov i get an interesting orthographic look. i then build the environment almost as if it was a full third person game.

bullets imo. plus since the cdc can actually study guns now they can do tests on every different type of gun and every different type of bullet, measure the speed, damage done, entrance and exit wounds etc and create a guideline on what types of guns and bullets are permissible for civilians to have and what ones are not.

ar-15 bullets are super fast and light and with a 30 round clip you can do way more damage than you would with a shot gun that you have to reload after every two shots. also registering guns with the government would be a logical thing to do that way they’d have to buy insurance and if their son used their gun to shoot up a school the gun owner would have to pay a fine or face jail time for not properly securing the gun and having an unlicensed user fire it.

gli unici problemi:

* la prima volta meglio farlo andare sotto supervisione per vedere se non ci sono mobili/pensili/caloriferi etc in cui possa incastrarsi e/o fare danni (in casa nuova non abbiamo potuto farlo girare in cucina fino a che non hanno sistemato lo zoccolino, rischiava di rovinare i mobili)
* bisogna stare attenti a non lasciare in giro calzini, cavi usb o altre cose che possono essere aspirate;
* tappeti: se sono molto leggeri capita che li spinga/se li porti dietro e a volte finisce per incastrarsi con le ruote che girano a vuoto;
* talvolta capita che se il robot viene ruotato (anche impercettibilmente) mentre è attaccato alla sua base la mappa risulta completamente disallineata e rischia di andare un po' in confusione",italy,214,195,114,54,70,49,43,49,27

2-- a ton of warmth in their facial expressions and very easily emotionally moved. super expressive. looking around at everyone but especially at high status people in the room.

3-- decisive movements like a 1 but not as jarring, looking around the room for the competition, or the people they need to impress lol. a three i'm friends with just sits around studying people sometimes like they are a challenging puzzle to be conquered. 

4-- expressive faces like a 2, but it comes from their internal experience more than what's going on with other people. look small but also project confidence in their style and emotions.

5-- quiet usually. uncomfortable in rooms with many people, relaxes when talking about something they know a lot about or are interested in. zones out in conversations they find boring. 

6 cp-- nervous energy, but also wild overconfidence that feels a bit false. may have a bit of 'resting bitch face' and tries to make themselves intimidating. 

6 p-- also nervous energy, covered by likability and self deprivation instead of confidence. looks to other people on the room for validation and guidance.

7-- restless body language, always moving a little bit even if their sitting still. talks very fast, may switch between topics of conversation several times in the course of a few minutes. 

8-- brief sentences that tell you what you need to know. protective energy, they are automatically the people everyone in the room is looking to for leadership because they have an aura of authority even if they don't mean to project that.

9-- slow movements, not usually in a hurry. seem to absorb people's energy and reflect back a lesser version instead of reacting to it with their own. may be very self deprecating and not assertive.

it is about ""winning over the other side"" is the wrong approach imo. so, trump has 90% approval by republicans, so instead of trying to win over independents and people who don't normally vote... you want to try to convince what? 4% of republicans to vote for yang?

535,Cairo-TenThirteen,"it's not the easiest thing to describe but i'll give it a try. for me, dissociative mania is the following:

i notice my emotions constantly changing without much warning, and without much reason. i can be happy one moment and then angry the next, with nothing external actually changing. my emotions are always extremely intense and hard to control.

my memories get skewed. when i think back on the day i sometimes struggle to remember the order in which things happened. sometimes i make up memories too.

i switch between periods of feeling like a genius who has figured everything out, and feeling like an idiot who is simply deluded. 

i switch between feeling powerful and significant, and feeling worthless and non-existent.

i hate looking at myself in the mirror because i always look like a caricature or parody of myself. 

but perhaps the biggest aspect of dissociative mania for me is that i start to see a lot of coincidences and 'signs'. my life starts to feel like a mystery which is full of clues for me to piece together. i feel like i am getting subtle messages telling me to do something. it deceives me into thinking that my gut instincts and intuitions are amazing, and that i can simply 'sense' things. 

i'll give an example. this happened quite a few months ago. near the end of a 3-meo-pce 'trip' i started to get the craving for food. it was midnight, and i was planning on ordering a pizza. i picked up my phone to order it through the app but i kept spacing out and forgetting what i was doing, which made me unimaginably frustrated. during the time that i was trying to order the pizza, a childhood memory of me eating ice cream flashed into my mind. it was a good memory, and it made me smile. but i didn't want ice cream, i wanted pizza. however, somehow i convinced myself that the memory was a sign that i should get ice cream instead. i looked on the pizza (dominos) app to see what ice cream they had but somehow i got convinced that i shouldn't be 'ordering' ice cream, i should be going outside to get some. there was a 24 hour shop near me, so i thought i should walk over there to get some. i wasn't going outside because i actually wanted ice cream, i was going outside because i thought it was important that i did. i thought that something significant would happen on the way to buy it, and that was why the memory flashed into my mind. 

i did go to the shop and get the ice cream, and obviously nothing happened. i then ordered my pizza. i then convinced myself that the whole thing was just a 'test' to see if i was 'paying attention' to the universe i guess. once i sobered up, i noticed how strange that whole experience was.

i think that's a kinda extreme example of dissociative mania, but i hope it helps understand it. it's a pretty harmless example, but i know it fucks up some people more than that. my dose of 3-meo-pce was 13mg.

edit: other people are mentioning how mania often involves extreme euphoria. i forgot to mention that, but yeah i agree. extreme and erratic euphoria is certainly an aspect of mania. it's not obvious, but i really really enjoyed going outside to get ice cream. i had a shit ton of energy during it.",researchchemicals,291,264,151,79,91,57,58,62,36

548,elibor12,"here ist he full review. for anyone who doesn't want to click on the link and give ad revenue to these terrible authors.

&gt; darren franich was planning to review the new netflix series the witcher by himself. then he watched half an hour of the premiere and begged his critical colleague kristen baldwin to join his quest. the results were not pretty.

&gt; kristen: i don’t know, should we start with the wig? the two most important things hollywood learned from the lord of the rings films are as follows: 1) it is possible to make an entire movie franchise about people walking, and 2) if you cast a hunk as a gentle-hearted fantasy-realm hero, make sure to put him in a white-blonde wig that looks like it was snatched straight from the head of jennifer elise cox in the brady bunch movie. and so poor, beefy henry cavill — who stars as geralt of rivia, the titular witcher — finds himself saddled with a flowing, distracting mane of flaxen locks.

&gt; his hair is definitely the brightest thing about the witcher’s first episode, which takes place in the dreary, muddy, soot-colored town of blaviken. it’s a place where people don’t cotton to witchers, at least if the grimy, bearded man geralt encounters in the pub is to be believed. “we don’t want your kind around here, witcher,” he growls. rude. anyhow, the pilot also features two rough-and-tumble princesses (freya allan, emma appleton), a wizard (lars mikkelsen), and totally gratuitous full-frontal female nudity. there are seven naked women in the first episode alone, darren. seven! i… think i’ve seen enough?

&gt; darren: kristen, i have a confession. i am a member of the henry cavill appreciation society. the big super-brit was a deadpan delight in the goofball spyfest the man from u.n.c.l.e. and a brilliantly looming tower in the most recent mission: impossible. why, oh why, oh why he opted to star in a series that buries him under a bad wig and worse color contacts is a mystery to me.

&gt; or maybe it’s a failure of franchise-chasing. the witcher comes from novels by andrzej sapkowski, which also inspired an acclaimed video game series. i haven’t played the games, but the pilot has certain tropes from that medium exported without imagination to television. there’s the constant download of fantasy verbiage, including much talk about a “kikimora” and a town i swear is called “blevicum.” mikkelsen’s character has a big line about how geralt “made a choice,” which feels like a hat-tip to the open-world nature of the games. the intention here is dark pulp fantasy, so this is the kind of show where a character like appleton’s renfri is a princess and a mutant who has sex with geralt the night before they battle to the death.

&gt; i’m definitely not averse to the wild extremes of this genre — shout-out to the visceral blood terrors of adult swim’s primal — but the first episode felt like cheese gone moldy. that nude bordello really edged the whole vibe in a fratty direction, and the long running time required a lot of take-forever talk about prophecies and destiny. did you watch further into the season?

&gt; kristen: in the interest of professional obligation, darren, i did sit through the second episode, which was notable for a few reasons. (spoiler: none of those reasons include, “because it was good.”) henry cavill gets far less screen time in the second hour — and he has to share his few scenes with a very, very annoying traveling bard (i would name the actor who plays him, but i’m fairly certain the writers didn’t even bother to name the character?). anyhow, this very annoying traveling singer makes up tunes about abortion and says things like, “there i go again, just delivering exposition.”

&gt; most of the second episode is devoted to the travails of a deformed young woman named yennefer (anya chalotra), whose jerk of a father sells her off to a haughty witch named tissaia de vries (myanna buring). it turns out yennifer has some untapped magical abilities, and she finds herself enrolled in tissaia’s school of witchcraft and wizardry, or whatever she calls it. so now this show is the magiciansfeaturing special guest star henry cavill, i guess?

&gt; the witcher is also packed with confusing conflicts and long-held rivalries that require a lot of explanation but still manage to make no sense. the premiere sets up a princess-wizard showdown that is related to a curse (i think), while episode 2 introduces a budding war between elves and humans. apparently the elves taught the humans how to turn something called “chaos” into magic, and then the humans unleashed a genocide on them. “i was once filavandrel of the silver towers,” notes a majestic elf (tom canton). “now i’m filavandrel of the edge of the world.” so yeah, this is some high-school level dungeons &amp; dragons role play with a multi-million-dollar budget. netflix canceled the far cheaper, far more entertaining the good cop for this?

&gt; darren: because life’s too short for netflix drama running times, i skipped ahead to the fifth episode, which brings the yennefer and geralt plotlines together. episode 5 also features magic viagra and a masked orgy set to some truly ridiculous retro-softcore music. i do think there’s room for a mature-content fantasy romp in our post-game of thrones universe, but eternal exposition runs alongside a tin ear for dialogue.

&gt; this is the first tv show i’ve ever seen that would actually be better with commercial breaks. the goofy syndicated fantasy of yesteryear had to have a brisk pace, building every 12 minutes to an act-breaking cliffhanger. the witcher fully embraces the endless-movie layout of the worst blank check streaming tv. at the end of the series premiere, someone tells allen’s princess ciri that geralt is her destiny. in episode 5, people are still telling her that geralt is her destiny. i assume they will meet in the season finale. alas, my destiny is to never watch this borefest ever again. grade: f",television,301,273,152,81,93,57,59,66,37

something like cancelling the watch and act message without an absolutely explicit direction that the area is no longer under any threat requires second-guessing by all parties concerned. i stand by that 100%. 

the fire at angle vale was in name only because it started at the far eastern extreme of angle vale - the localities of concern were hillier, kudla and evanston gardens. the area directly west of gawler. this area is nearly 20km from waterloo corner and the main area of the fire immediately north of adelaide international raceway - hardly a couple of kilometres. it's far enough to be believed instead of dismissing it out of hand. not to mention the map had shown an incident there for at least 20 minutes at the time of the call.

i have written previously on how the cfs release information. for anyone who cares enough to listen to the radio 24/7 it is slow, confusing and very light on important detail. for someone checking in once every 3 hours i'm sure it is very helpful. elsewhere in this thread i advocate some sort of reliable automatic emergency alert system so that alerts can get to the right people all the time, every time.

as for the rail subsidy - this is london and city centric. it effectively means that the rest of us living in rural areas subsidise those living in the city.

but a fetus can live if it’s mother dies, so again, your logic is flawed and incoherent. 

&gt; yes. if a woman was raped, the pregnancy was forced onto her.

then you are positing that the abortion of a child not conceived through rape is more immoral than one conceived by rape. why?

&gt; exodus 21 says that abortions shall be punishable by death, that's it. it does not say ""all murders should be punishable"". you're just making this up.

first of all, i’m happy to get your admission that my primary argument is correct. but secondly, verse 12 clearly shows that murder in general is punishable by death. i would encourage you to read the passage before commenting on it to avoid embarrassment. 

&gt; and you still haven't replied: ""what should the punishment be?""

i have replied. you quoted my reply immediately following this mistake. imprisonment should be the punishment. 

&gt; where in the bible does it say that the punishment for adultery should be imprisonment? you're making this up.

it doesn’t say this. i’m appealing to our modern legal system here, since we do not live under the sinai covenant.

605,railz0,"what you are describing still has the plain, self-explanatory name “baiting”. “kiting” or “orb walking” in video games is a set of repetitive moves performed to attack the enemy, usually one with lower attack range than yours, while maintaining a fixed distance if possible - this also depends on the speed of each character. to execute at the highest level it requires precise timing (talking in ms), muscle memory and hand-eye coordination, all of which comes through practice.

however, the entire basis of this concept requires the character to be unable to move backwards while attacking, so i wouldn’t compare it to the parthian shot. a step by step description of what happens would be:

* run from your opponent
* turn around
* start winding up your (higher range) attack
* as soon as your attack is fired, turn around
* run from your opponent
* ...

how long you run between attacks depends on how often the game allows you to attack. without practicing kiting you would attack, stand in place for time t, attack again. kiting utilizes this attack downtime to create distance and prevent retaliation. in some games this is more difficult to pull off efficiently because most characters have turn rates (dota 2) which add significant delay to kiting, while others have their characters rotate instantly (league of legends), which makes knowing how “to kite” your opponents mandatory. hope this is a sufficient explanation.",todayilearned,338,303,167,93,104,64,60,67,42

613,TheGreatestWeeaboo,"the *example* is silly for the reasons you noticed (simplistic, qua**nt**itatively breaks outside 1 allele:1 phenotype situations), and it has further flaws you didn't mention:

* splitting the population into generations
* lack of genetic drift
* lack of mutation rate
* fitness(aa) set up to zero
* even disregarding epistasis and pleiotropy, a human can carry multiple harmful alleles

however the *reasoning* isn't silly and can be qua**l**itatively expanded to other situations. what to keep in mind: as long as the allele in question has harmful effects in some of its carriers, it'll be eventually selected against, *even if recessive*. as time goes by, mortality rate goes down.

&gt;it simply doesn’t make sense to assume the recessive allele would exist at all in a sample of six individuals

nobody here is assuming. i've set up p(aa) = 100% because, if p(aa) decreases over time, you can use a situation starting with higher p(aa) to understand one with lower p(aa).

&gt;the population of aas always grows *exponentially* larger than the population of aas

linear, not exponential.

&gt;if this was the case, then the process of culling would have started dozens of generations or more before the show’s events

it does. more precisely, this process is *always* going on, with or without a population bottleneck.

&gt;and thus the vast majority of people would be aa.

and they are. we don't *completely* get rid of those alleles due to a small mutation rate regenerating them.

&gt;this would statistically mean incest would be harmless the majority of the time, which is not the case. 

and it is, for any given harmful phenotype you might have. the two things missing in this scenario are:

* genetic drift - if *one* of the astronauts carries a harmful allele, it's already 16.7% of the population.
* multiple harmful alleles - we don't *know* how many harmful alleles we should expect that population to have. (you don't expect lots of them though, due to their statistical rarity - for the reasons you said yourself, we've been *already* weeding them out.)

there's a big difference between the astronauts and the ~~habinzucht~~ habsburg: even if the first generations would be inbred, other generations would actively avoid inbreeding, preferring more distant relatives to closer ones. while this the chin kept marrying their first cousins, aunts, etc. for multiple generations.",ShitpostersOfSCIENCE,344,307,170,94,105,64,60,67,42

i'm referring to keim's fuck up (this time)  is because he reportedly had a chance to land a top 15 draft pick and shitty wr from philly. this is after p2 chose to get suspended, requested to be traded, deleted all his cardinals content, and is turning 30. remember when keim said he'd personally pick him up at midnight? pretty shitty message to send to the young players on this team on how the fo expects you to handle yourself.

hindsight is clear, and it is easy to say that he hasn't been good, but if the front office had any idea what they're doing, they would have acknowledged this ""retool"" (rebuild) could have benefited from more picks. now, it seems like his value has tanked, and the defense has been worse since his return.

**it’s alright, too stripped back and hollow compared to the original**

2.	what is your favorite moment lyrically?

**no malice whole verse is pretty fire**

3.	what is your favorite moment musically?

**the backing vocals during no malice verse is the most beautiful part to me**

4.	where would you rank this song on the album? one of the best, one of the weakest...?

**definitely a high point, but that’s considering that there isn’t many high points on the album**

5.	do you wish this song had been any different (ex: you don’t like certain lines, you wish it had been shorter/longer, etc.)

**i wish kanye had some backing vocals on his voice during the chorus so it wasn’t so empty, maybe added a vocoder or something, and definitely would have added the guitar solo back, the sax just causes the song to stop abruptly and kinda kills it for me.**

6.	does this song evoke certain emotions in you? does it put you in a good/uplifting/joyful mood, or do you feel sad/nostalgic/bummed out after hearing it?

**bummed out for what could have been, honestly**

7.	is this song overrated/underrated or does it get the credit it deserves?

**i think it gets its credit, clipse came through and did well as expected, the music is amazing as expected.**

8.	how would you rate this song on a scale from 1 to 10?

675,Bullgrid,"it depends how you look at it. in aovs case, the game is kind of built to perform better on ios, but most medium-high end androids have no issues running it on high graphics and fps.

ive tried the game on asus with snapdragon 835, s8 and s9, huawei with kirin 980 and on ios; and they all run the game perfectly fine. my best experience has been with the huawei.

in my opinion it's about value for money. to play the game optimally you don't need a beast phone, but going for the more expensive phone will let you play it on a better screen with higher resolution and prettier colors.

that said, no matter what your needs and focus is, there is no reason to buy the newer iphones. a mate 20 pro or p30 pro is in the same price range as an iphone 11, but the iphone 11 runs a hd lcd screen while huawei, samsung and asus has oled and superamoled for the same price - with a much bigger battery much higher pixel density.

tldr;
if your focus is strictly gaming - asus rog phone is for you. it's in the same price range as the others but runs a 90hz screen which is by far the best screen around. the bulky and unusual design is a downside for many, but the costumization and stuff you can buy for a better gaming experience can be real nice for aov and rift.

if you want a good all rounder that does everything well -  huawei mate 20 pro or p30 pro are my favourites. huge battery, beautiful screens and amazing camera in a sleek design. this is right for you if you spend a lot of time on the phone but dont nesessarily play games all the time.

if you want to keep the price a little lower - i recommend the asus zenfone 5/6 or huawei nova. they do everything the phones above do at half the price, but lacks in the camera and screen departments. they boast amazing hardware and runs the game perfectly fine, but again the game will look better on a nicer screen.

hope that helps. :)",arenaofvalor,377,329,182,102,120,72,68,70,54

i didn't say they are *the* problem, but they are a very big factor.

do you mean the same japan that's supposedly one of the safest countries on the planet with a [99% conviction rate](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/02/03/national/media-national/japans-suicide-statistics-dont-tell-the-real-story/) and it's [very own](https://www.businessinsider.com/japanese-family-life-is-falling-apart-2017-5?r=de&amp;ir=t), and [rather unique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rental_family_service), socioeconomic issues? 

is that a regular habit of yours, comparing pears to oranges to willfully miss the point?

then we just fundamentally disagree. washington, maybe. cal and asu are below ok state, texas, and isu by quite a margin imo.

while true, asu lost to some garbage teams, not the best teams in the league like isu. oregon state (5-7), ucla (4-8), colorado (5-7).

&gt;the upper middle big12 teams having slightly better records doesn't necessarily mean they are better teams.

why not? we play a round robin. no one gets to duck the best teams in the conference.

eh, they beat them by 14 at home in the 3rd week of the season playing against a first year coach. not exactly a resounding thumping.

texas played both ou and lsu within 7 pts. utah did not blow out washington.

ha, that's basically even. not like you're a 14 pt favorite. 

&gt;this next part is speculation, but i believe the ou brand name actually shifts where oddsmakers put that line in ous favor, so ignoring brand name my guess is that gives a more realistic 3.5 or so point edge to utah.

my speculation is that a lot of people misinterpret ou's weaknesses. our offense is obviously top notch, our defense is actually top 25. our true weakness: turnovers. 

in the second half against baylor we had 1 turnover and were absolutely dominant. in the game against ok state, we had no turnovers and were dominant. turnovers are a problem, but are more easily fixed that systemically flawed offenses or defenses. if we turn the ball over 1 time or less against utah, i think we win soundly",CFB,409,366,201,112,138,77,75,74,56

* questioning the dislike towards groups of people we didn't know for being different in ways that wasn't our business (i.e., didn't all that civil rights stuff y'all taught me about say different???)
* questioning the teaching that me accepting their position of what i as a woman should tolerate from the men in my life (the father/brother/husband comes first, even before the needs of kids.) will bring me true happiness and nothing bad would ever happen
* asking about why don't they hold themselves up to standard? (why are you selling ""holy oil"" in church after reading about jesus running the sellers out of the synagogue? )

762,KayUndae,"i have to agree, the media made a big deal out of the ‘anti-semitism’ in the labour party and how corbyn refused to apologise for it at first. while i think an investigation is needed, i wonder if the majority of the anti-semitic allegations were simply those that didn’t see palestine as evil. it’s a difficult subject but i have always felt both israel and palestine are at fault in many ways and it’s our fault because it was our parliament that created the problem in the first place. corbyn did apologise in the end. 

yet the media didn’t treat boris’ comments about lgbt people and single mothers to the same level of disgust, it was kind of brushed away and i’m not aware if he ever apologised for those comments. same with reese-mogg who is part of a “member club” with very fascist and britain first views. 

the problem was, while i respect corbyn for believing in what he’s believed in since he became a politician (much like sanders) but he needed to make a simple stance on brexit. that’s all the media painted this election as: the brexit election. and we only really knew that the stance that he would offer his own brexit deal as well as a remain option in a second referendum. so for many it seemed he was still endorsing brexit. 

i don’t know how others see johnson as any better, but that’s the media for you and because those that voted to leave in 2016 are stubborn fuckers who don’t want to be wrong. we’re all tired of brexit, and i think most people wanted to just give in and get it over with. our voting system is broken and outdated but with a tory majority we won’t be seeing a change anytime soon.",worldnews,420,374,208,120,141,80,77,77,57

it depends on where you live, definitely talk to your therapist or psychiatrist, usually you'll need them or a doctor to sign off on a form you fill out (and the doctor or w/e fills out a portion of it describing why you can't work and for how long, stuff like that). the amount depends on where you're located, what your disability is, how much expenses you have (ie: rent, food, etc).

 i live in canada and the process &amp; amount differed province to province, in alberta i was only able to get income assistance w/ medical clearance saying i couldn't work for x amount of time and i got around $300-$700 a month depending on what my current living situation was at the moment. (applying for &amp; being approved for full disability in alberta is extremely difficult, i was denied the first time and by the time my second application was processed, which took a whole year, i'd moved to bc. i would've received $1500 once a month for about two years if i was still in alberta ��) 

now in bc, i was easily approved for disability &amp; i get roughly $880 a month but there's no time constraints for how long i can be on it, and in allowed to work while receiving it too. your therapist/psychiatrist/doctor can help you through the process, usually they can obtain a form for you or you can pick one up at your equivalent of a government services building. then they can help you fill it out &amp; apply!",relationship_advice,443,393,225,126,150,85,82,79,61

825,TRS2917,"so, in the 1970s many arthouse filmmakers saw erotica and pornography as a new frontier in film making. when films like deepthroat experienced mainstream success, it opened the door for filmmakers to push the boundaries of sexual content on film without having to worry about whether a market existed for such salacious films. the europeans basically dove headfirst into erotic films with the long running emmanuel series, the coming of sin, vampyros lesbos etc. next to these films, nothing about borowczyk's films is especially ""perverted"" unless you have a giant stick up your ass. i suppose the beast is exceptionally kinky with it's rapey horse-cocked furry critter but since it exists as a kinkier telling of the beauty and the beast, i wouldn't exactly call it uniquely subversive. 

in the context of the time the idea of a ""strong female"" in a film wasn't really in the collective consciousness and i think it's really unfair to look back on the 1970s and poo poo a film for having subservient or weaker female characters--particularly when it comes to erotic films. themes of submission are common, even in erotic fiction targeting women and i wouldn't say that these films were necessarily crafted to shift the sexual politics of the time. 

in any case, the emergence of video killed the arthouse aspirations of erotic and pornographic content. the dream-like vaseline smeared lenses of european filmmakers mostly disappeared and were replaced by endless plumbers and pizza delivery guys being shagged by buxom ladies in plotless sleeze tapes.

so, to answer you original question: was borowczyk an innovator or a pervert? perhaps he is a bit of both. i see no problem with that; we all have fantasies and erotic visions and he level of craft certainly elevated him to the top of the heap among other erotic filmmakers in the 1970s. he was certainly a more able filmmaker than jess franco or joe d'amato.",TrueFilm,451,398,230,128,153,89,82,80,64

i bought this shirt a few years ago (maybe 2015?) on one of many thrifting trips. i honestly didn’t know what it was and bought it just for the graphic (shown on the right) and chest print (shown on the left). forgive me for not knowing at the time.

anyway, i recently have started going through and making clothing reselling a passive source of income for me. life’s expensive, you know? min wage isn’t cutting it for me anymore.

so i went through my closet and was looking at stuff i didn’t really wear and this gem resurfaced. i was looking around and i only found one potential source of info about it, saying it’s a grateful dead lot tee from their tour in the early 90s (specifically 1992 or 1993 of the oakland coliseum?). it’s got a combo of the muppets and sesame street characters on it if that helps any.

anyway, i was wondering if anyone here might have any information they could share on it. i don’t know how rare it might be (the one source of info said it was “super rare” but that’s a very common term in the collectibles/clothing resale world so i honestly don’t know).  

even if you can’t share any info, i thought this sub might appreciate getting to see it at least? i’m not sure who this might have belonged to in the past but i imagine there’s some great memories attached to it. i don’t really know much about gd but if any of you had fun stories or something to share, i’d love to hear it.

its projectile is very small, meaning you need good aim to begin with. then you have to compensate for the unusually low projectile velocity. and when you do, you get less damage per shot than many other supports do (or at least no better than they do) because your rifle's base damage is lower than their cannons.

then, just to rub it in, you have no useful mid-range sub weapon. the rest of your equipment is close-combat oriented (a beam saber and grenades). i like grenades, but not in lieu of a decent secondary weapon.

she doesn't have to have  sex if she isn't interested or can't but at same time you have right to your own sexual desires even if it doesn't include her. it doesn't have to include her.

you have 3 options.

take care of your own sexual desires in private.

open up the relationship so you can get your needs met elsewhere

be her friend not her partner and find a compatible partner that matches your sexual desires.

personally when i was younger even though i rarely was sexually attracted to anyone i did have libido and sexual needs but they were messed up due to past events and i had several very frustrating sexless relationships that made me very unhappy.

they didn't identify as asexual, sex just didn't happen and they did lot of hurtful abusive stuff to me around it so i was sorta scared to have sex with anyone and i felt lot of shame and conflict about it so i suffered for years about it.

i wouldn't wish this on anyone.

i personally i can't physically have sex for over decade now due to medical issues.

and relationships stress me out now and i never want another relationship.

but i lost lot of years of my life when i could being with people who very cruel and unavailable but expected monogamy from me and too many years very unhappy about my love/sex life.

those experiences negatively impacted how i viewed relationships, sexuality and my body.

if she really cares you she wouldn't  want to control/headtrip you away from that part of your life just because she isn't interested and doesn't get your interest in the activity like my ex's did to me.

if you really loved golf and she hated golf, it wouldn't be fair for her to expect you to stop playing gold if it was something you really loved doing. but she doesn't have learn to love to play golf.

she would recognize you have your own rights to interest, including sexual expression, and body autonomy just as much as she has her own even if it's lack of interest.

you can love someone and be interested in different things that you don't share with them.

and  you have right your own private space for that or find someone who could be there for you in that way.

she doesn't own your sexuality or sexual expression you do.

and you don't own hers.

your sexuality is yours, her romantic relationship doesn't equal ownership of your sexual choices.

your relationship with her doesn't equal you get to have sex with her. she has right to not want sex ever and have that right respected.

boundaries are good, respect that she doesn't want sex and you can be her friend or companion without anything sexual but she doesn't have the right to dictate  what you do with your own sexuality just because she isn't interested.

she doesn't have to give you sexual release but she should at least respect your needs to not headtrip you out of the freedom and privacy to take care of your own sexual needs or your right find someone who is interested in having sex with you.",Asexual,482,425,249,142,171,101,83,87,75

you should map out a plan for your life. you can't achieve a goal if you don't have an aim ya know?

personally i want to stop working or at least drop down to part-time as soon as possible; i don't mind living on a low income if i get my time back.
my friend however is happy to work full-time for the rest of his life as long as it affords him luxury.
different people want different things.

generally you want to put 6 months of living expenses away in a seperate account, this your 'i got fired and disowned and my friends won't let me couch surf and i'm getting deported and and and' life ruining emergency fund. it means independence and freedom. eg. you sign a lease, get a new job to afford the lease, your boss is a creep but you can't quit because you have to pay that lease. ew. however with the independence of the emergency fund you can quit your job and you have 6months breathing room to find another. 

next, try never to get a car loan. it seems superrrr normalised in america but it's a shitty idea. a loan on a depreciating asset isnt good. just keep doing what you were doing until you save the cash for a car. google insurance rates on the car model before you commit.

then from here it's really more dependant on your goals, you could save and invest, you could by a house and love with roomates, you could further your education.

967,Acornwow,"i think there's a lot to be learned from dating in your teens/early twenties. 

it teaches you about what you should be looking for and what you should try to avoid.

it also teaches you about what you should be bringing to a relationship, how to negotiate and how to communicate.  

it takes making mistakes to learn what you want and how to get it, so i don't dissuade young people from trying it out.

it's hard sometimes to watch people go through emotional agony, especially knowing that they've walked right into it or are perpetuating it themselves.  it's part of the process though. 

if we could all read a chapter in a book that told us how to have a healthy, mature relationship and skip all the bs then the world would be better off for it, but that's just not reality.  

everyone needs to work on being present and taking a mental/emotional inventory so that they are getting what they need and offering the most that they can to the people they are connecting to.  this may not necessarily apply to those that are out there just trying to get laid, but at some point they will decide they want more than that and if they haven't been practicing they will end up feeling pretty awful and not getting what they want.  

if you are worried that you are improperly investing in relationships now it's easy enough to take a step back and focus more on other areas of your life that you feel need attention.  

if you do decide that you want to be working on relationships though, just make sure you are doing your best to take care of yourself and your partner's needs.  at 22, you don't need to feel rushed to be married so just take in as much information as you can and focus on how you can use it to become the best partner you can be for your 'someone'.",relationship_advice,519,447,259,149,181,109,85,90,82

988,Phazon2000,"i watched about 4 seasons (there's like 23 episodes a season so that's nothing to sneeze at!)

it's a political show so it's inevitably going to be very preachy. if you like what they're preaching you'll enjoy it, if you don't you'll hate it. if you don't like the concept of someone preaching at you on principle, you also won't like it.

after numerous episodes fatigue eventually set in (plotlines strung together so unlike a show like star trek where you can refresh yourself after almost every episode - the west wing had mandatory catch ups before each episode starts because some plotlines drag out for quite a while. not normally something you see from shows with this many episodes). the constant political jargon and jumpy dialogue showed no quarter to the audience. great if you know your politics. anything beyond surface level interest and you're left in the dark so that was it for me.

997,AboveAllBeKind,"i agree - growing up catholic in coleraine/ballymoney, there was a certain exoticism to holidays in the south (or west!) - the towns looked different\* with the brightly-coloured buildings and celtic lettering on signage, the absence of flags and painted kerbstones was stark, people talked to you just for walking past them - at the time that was a sharp contrast! (one of them, mind, was a nun who asked me and my sis, aged 6 and 4, if we were protestant or catholic. we were just walking to the corner shop for a fat frog - she maybe heard our accent and was nosey for that reason. i didn't know, which affronted her - she said 'well do you believe in our lady, mother of god?' 'i've heard of her, yes', said i, and she said 'well you're a catholic then!' right you are so... anyway, i never really heard trad growing up, 'til i hung out with a load of musicians at 17/18 - and i'm sad about that, 'cos as a musician who played in orchestras and loved it, trad would have given great opportunities to travel and meet people in a very open way. (for those that don't know, there's a core repertoire most players would know, and if you rock into a pub with a session going on, by and large you're welcome to sit with the players and join in. lovely atmosphere.)

we also didn't have much gaelic sport at my catholic school while i was there - i played hockey (and a bit of tennis) and we tried girls' football for the craic. i think there might have been a camogie and hurling team, mostly of ones from limavady and dungiven, but that was after school only as far as i remember (never in our pe class), and i don't think there was any instruction in it. irish was optional and i chose german instead. i did irish festival dancing which was very distinct from feis dancing (think the lead dancer for riverdance recently was the first festival dancer to get the role). mad now living abroad to feel that i can't represent much irish culture, beyond a cúpla focal and a load of songs; will have to rectify that in 2020.
